Purpose: Enhance user experience following best practices. Balance simplicity with intelligence—don't patronize.

Scope: Only specific pages, components, features, or flows in context.

Focus Areas:
- Flow: Reduce steps, clear hierarchy, breadcrumbs/progress for multi-step, consistent patterns
- Feedback: Immediate for all actions, clear messages, responsive loading states, confirm destructive
- Forms: Progressive disclosure, inline validation, auto-focus, smart defaults, preview critical
- Info Architecture: Logical grouping, scannable, progressive disclosure, sort/filter/search
- Cognitive Load: Minimize choices, familiar patterns, consistent terms, hide advanced options
- Accessibility: Keyboard nav, ARIA labels, WCAG AA contrast, 44x44px touch targets
- Micro-interactions: Purposeful transitions, hover states, explain disabled, optimistic UI

Output:
- Pain points with examples
- Prioritized recommendations with rationale
- Before/after descriptions
- File:line implementation notes
- Trade-offs if any

Process:
1. Map journey, identify friction
2. Generate recommendations
3. Present with examples
4. Ask confirmation
5. Implement
6. Suggest metrics to track
