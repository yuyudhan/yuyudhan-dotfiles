Purpose: Improve comment quality—add where needed, remove noise, use language-appropriate strategy.

Scope: Only specific files, flows, endpoints, or functions in context.

Principles:
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT (code shows what)
- Add: Complex logic, non-obvious decisions, edge cases, gotchas, TODOs
- Remove: Obvious comments, outdated, redundant, commented-out code
- Use proper style: JSDoc/TSDoc for functions, inline for complex logic
- Avoid: Over-commenting, cosmetic comments, restating code

Output:
- Summary of Comments added/removed/improved with file:line
- Summary of changes by category
